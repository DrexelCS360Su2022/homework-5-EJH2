## Problem 4: Homework statistics

Please let us know how much time you spent on each problem. You may enter time using any format described [here](https://github.com/wroberts/pytimeparse). Please put your time estimates *on the same line* as the problem label, not on the following line.

Problem 1: 20m

These problems weren't that difficult, building each part consecutively was quite helpful.

Problem 2: 2h

Part 1 and Part 2 took a bit longer than I would have liked to have figured out, but I was massively overthinking Part 3 for way too long.

Problem 3:  4h

If I never see a powerset question again, I will die a *VERY* happy man
